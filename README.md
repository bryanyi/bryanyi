Hey there! <img style="display:inline" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px" height="25px">

I'm [Bryan Yi](http://www.bryanyi.com).

<br/>

I'm a self-taught developer (thank god for YouTube) who transitioned from healthcare to software engineering. Through pure grit, passion, and a growth mindset, I studied every day while maintaining a full-time job as a medical assistant at an ENT clinic to deepen my understanding of computer science to ultimately land my first gig.

I've been enamored with computer science since I learned about the field. Outside of work, I enjoy practicing calisthentics, learning Polyphia riffs on the electric guitar, bouldering, discovering different coffee bean flavors (`CoffeeBrewMethods myDailyDriver = CoffeeBrewMethods.MOKA_POT`), and day dreaming with my wife about adopting a grey hound and a staffy.

Lately, I've been diving into websockets and multithreading with Java within distributed sytems, and Rust+wgpu.
