### Hey there! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">

I'm [Bryan Yi](http://www.bryanyi.com).

In September of 2020, my best friend introduced me to the world of programming. Since then I have been using the plethora of resouces online to teach myself the basics of web development and software engineering. I managed to create two full-stack projects and a [portfolio](http://www.bryanyi.com) in a couple months, and now in the process of interviewing for software developer positions.
