Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a self-taught developer (thank god for YouTube) who transitioned from healthcare to software engineering. I studied every day between my full-time job and on the weekends to land my first gig within 9 months. 

I've been enamored with computer science since I learned about the field. Outside of work, I love exercising at the gym, kickboxing, playing guitar, snowboarding, and going on morning walks with my wife.

Lately, I've been having fun learning Java/Springboot, microservices, and devops.
