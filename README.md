Hey there! <img style="display:inline" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px" height="25px">

I'm [Bryan Yi](http://www.bryanyi.com).

<br/>

I'm a self-taught developer (thank god for YouTube) who transitioned from healthcare to software engineering. I studied every day between my full-time job and on the weekends to land my first gig within 9 months. 

I've been enamored with computer science since I learned about the field. Outside of work, I love weight lifting at the gym, playing guitar, snowboarding, and going on calm morning walks with my wife.

Lately, I've been having fun learning more about Java/Springboot and microservices.
